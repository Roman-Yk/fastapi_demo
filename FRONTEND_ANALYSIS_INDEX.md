## Key Issues at a Glance

| # | Issue | Location | Impact | Priority |
|---|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Type Duplication | `types/document.ts` + `components/orders/OrderDocumentsUpload.tsx` | Sync bugs when updating enums | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Misleading "Admin" Folder | `components/admin/` | Mixed generic + specific components | HIGH |
| 3 | Scattered Components | 4 different locations | Hard to find & maintain order features | HIGH |
| 4 | Non-Discoverable Services | `services/` scattered | Wastes dev time searching | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Mixed Type Concerns | `types/order.ts` | Domain + UI logic intertwined | MEDIUM |

## Quick Start

### If you have 15 minutes:
1. Read: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
2. Understand the 5 key issues
3. Understand quick fix vs full refactoring

### If you have 1 hour:
1. Read: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. Read: FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md (20 min)
3. Skim: FRONTEND_REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md (15 min)
4. Decide on approach

### If you want to execute:
1. Read: FRONTEND_REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md completely
2. Use the file movement checklist
3. Follow the phases in order

## Real Code Problems Found

### Problem 1: Type Duplication (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// File 1: /src/types/document.ts
export enum OrderDocumentType {
  T1 = 'T1',
  MIO = 'MIO',
  // ...
}

// File 2: /src/components/orders/OrderDocumentsUpload.tsx (line 39)
export enum OrderDocumentType {
  T1 = "T1",  // Note: different quote style!
  MIO = "MIO",
  // ...
}

// These DIVERGE if one is updated but not the other
```

**Fix**: Delete the duplicate in OrderDocumentsUpload.tsx (15 minutes)

### Problem 2: Misleading "Admin" Folder
```
/src/components/admin/
├── fields/
│   ├── TextField.tsx              ✓ Generic
│   ├── BadgeField.tsx             ✓ Generic
│   ├── PriorityField.tsx          ✗ Order-specific!
│   ├── ReferenceDriverField.tsx   ✗ Order-specific!
│   └── ReferenceVehicleField.tsx  ✗ Order-specific!
```

Folder name implies "admin panel components" but contains both generic UI components AND order-specific domain components.

**Fix**: Rename to "ui" folder, move domain-specific components to domains/ (1 hour)

### Problem 3: Scattered Order Components
```
Order code lives in 4 places:
- /src/components/orders/OrderDocumentsUpload.tsx
- /src/components/features/orders/OrderGrid.tsx
- /src/components/features/orders/OrderFiltersForm.tsx
- /src/components/admin/fields/[5 order-specific fields]
```

**Fix**: Move all to `/src/domains/orders/` (2 hours)

### Problem 4: Type File Mixing
```typescript
// /src/types/order.ts contains:
export interface Order { ... }              // Domain model
export enum OrderService { ... }            // Backend domain
export enum DateFilterOption { ... }        // Frontend UI only
export enum LocationFilter { ... }          // Frontend UI only
export enum StatusFilter { ... }            // Frontend UI only
export const OrderServiceLabels = { ... }   // Frontend UI strings
export interface OrderFilters { ... }       // Frontend UI state
```

All mixed in one file. Should be split by concern.

**Fix**: Split into: order.ts (domain only), constants.ts (enums), filters.ts (UI filters)

### Problem 5: Services Not Co-located
```
Services scattered:
- /src/services/apiService.ts (old, not used)
- /src/services/apiServices.ts (new, actively used)
- /src/services/orderDocumentService.ts (separate, why?)

Should be:
- /src/domains/orders/services/
- /src/domains/documents/services/
- /src/domains/drivers/services/
- etc.
```

## Benefits of Fixing

### Immediate (Quick Fix)
- Prevents enum sync bugs
- Clearer code organization
- Better developer experience

### Long-term (Full Refactor)
- Single place to work on any feature
- Easy to find code when needed
- Services are discoverable
- Clear separation: generic UI vs specific domains
- Easy to add new features consistently
- Easy to deprecate entire domains
- Faster onboarding for new developers

---

## Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Fix Critical Bug (Now - 15 min)
Delete duplicate `OrderDocumentType` enum from `OrderDocumentsUpload.tsx`

### Step 2: Plan Full Refactoring (Next sprint)
Use FRONTEND_REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md to plan execution

### Step 3: Execute Incrementally (2-3 days)
- Phase 1: Create directory structure (safe)
- Phase 2: Move services (low risk)
- Phase 3: Extract types (medium risk)
- Phase 4: Move components (high risk but contained)
- Phase 5: Cleanup & testing
